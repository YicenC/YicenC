- 👋 Hi, I’m @YicenC. A mom with 2 kids, who's not able to take a full time job away from home right now. I live in Suzhou, China. It's a city next to Shanghai. Suzhou is specialized in BioChemical and high-end manufacture industries. 
- 👀 I’m interested in working in the field of Data Science in a few years.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, math, Data Science, and everything that will support a future job in big data analysis.
- 💞️ I’m at the very beginning point now, only finished Python & Math basics. Hope to get more progress fast, but kids' summer vacation is coming...
- 📫 Guess I can't help much right now, but here's my email: caoyicen@qq.com, if anyone ever sees this...
